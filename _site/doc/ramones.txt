"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I

'92 spells more fun, let's get into gear
'Cause a picture never does
'Cause baby I love you I really do
'Cause baby without you, I have no one
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
'Cause Christmas ain't the time for breaking each other's hearts
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
'Cause everybody knows
'Cause I don't want to be with anybody else
'Cause I got my other worries
'Cause I'm affected, 'fected
'Cause I'm looking for something to believe in
'Cause I've got my eyes on the Russian Bear
'cause in sleepy London town
'Cause it's 20 below
'Cause lately it all sounds the same to me
'Cause no one's been what I've been through
'Cause she's a spy for the BBI
'Cause she's my sweetheart
'Cause she's the only girl that I'm ever thinking of
'Cause somebody put something in my drink
'cause summer's here, and the time is right
'Cause that's not where I wanna be
'Cause there's nobody groovin'
'Cause there's nothing wrong
'Cause they treat me so bad
'cause this sleepy London town
'Cause we fought so hard
'Cause when I'm with you I can't control myself
'Cause when it comes
'cause where I live the games they play
'Cause you don't need no one
'Cause you know that I'm the one
'Cause you're a loudmouth babe
'Cause you're so lazy
'cept to sing for a rock and roll band
'Til forever on it goes through the circle fast and slow
'Til it stops at the top of the ferris wheel

About this world
Above alpine peaks
Above the highest stars
Abstract city don't give a damn
Abstract man
Across the streams of hopes and dreams where things are really not
Action is his reward
After all these years I'm still alive
After it's over nowhere to go
After the school day
Again & again
Ah ah oh yea oh oh oh yea
Ah, but I was so much older then
Ah, Tipper come on, ain't you been getting it on?
Ah, Tipper come on, it's just a smoke
Ah, you took a walk with me and
Ain't comin down, no I'm too wired
Ain't enough hours in the day
Ain't gonna be easy 'cause I get real mean
Ain't gonna hide under the bed
Ain't gonna take it
Ain't it great to be alive
Ain't it neat?
Ain't my reality to me
Ain't never gonna change my ways
Ain't no loser or quitter
Ain't no-one gonna hold it back for long
Alan Freed, and high energy?
All alone in the danger zone
All day working on a truck
All depressed all alone
All dressed up an' the sun sets low
All good cretins go to heaven
All he wanted was some fun
All I care about is me
All I get from you is your bad attitude
All I got was self-pity and tears
All is quiet on the eastern front
All is very well, C.J. is here
All messed up, hey everyone
All my best things are in hock
All night
All of a sudden I feel a chill
All right, oh yeah
All Screwed Up
All the children are tucked in their beds
All the girls are in love with me
All the kids wanna sniff some glue
All the kids want somethin' to do
All the people
All the time
All The Way
All they wanna give me
All's Quiet On the Eastern Front
Almost lost my mind - oh, oh
Always biting on my nails
Always laughing at your expense
Always loaded, always high
Always looking over my shoulder
Always ready for what ever's gonna happen
Always screamin' at someone
Always stieff, all day long
Always stiff, it never fails
Always wearin' that cheap perfume
America is the only home
American girls knock me out, ya know
Ancient goblins, and warlords
And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul
And after just one night
And all I want is you
And all the joys within you dies
And all the love so pure
And all you ever want to be
And all you gotta do is just wink your eye
And as you walk through life
And checkin' out the parties for surfer girls
And do the cretin hop
And don't you wanna
And everything's gonna be real fine
And everytime I eat vegetables
And find out
And find out if
And for girls I had a that yen
And get beaten up by that goon
And get down on my knees and pray, that they go away
And headin' out singing our song
And I can't forget that look on her face
And I can't wait 'til tomorrow
And I could always tell when
And I don't care
And I don't do what people want me to do
And I don't know where to begin, oh no
And I don't know where to begin, to begin
And I don't know where to start
And I don't wanna be learned
And I don't wanna be tamed
And I don't wanna die before I live
And I don't want to live this life
And I feel like I'm gonna die
And I feel like I'm in paradise
And I had quite a ball
And I just need something to believe in
And I knew it was going
And I knew something wasn't right
And I know I just can't trust myself
And I know just what to do
And I know that if I had her back today
And I learned quite a lot
And I never care what people think
And I said good-bye
And I sure was bleedin' the drops by
And I tell you I love you
And I think of times we were together
And I was so much older then
And I wonder is life a drag
And I'll fish
And I'll fly
And I'll sin
And I'll walk
And I'm against..
And I'm alone just me
And I'm crazy, crazy, crazy
And I'm going after it
And I'm gonna use it well
And I'm not sorry for the things I do
And I'm okay when I'm here with you
And I've give up trying to understand what I can't
And if my woody breaks down, I'll get somewhere as a surfer Surf City
And if you have to know I'll never understand you
And if your party falls
And in a moment of passion
And inside my heart I feel I'm dying
And it crushed my soul
And it may sound funny, but it's true
And it's getting very unexciting
And it's going on two years
And it's not gonna happen
And it's not my place
And life makes promises it can't keep
And my lean, mean heart
And my misery
And my soul has been psychedelicized
And neon lights always gow hot
And no one's gonna ever tear us apart
And now I can wake up and face the day
And now you dare to look me in the eye
And oh, I don't know why
And oh, I don't know why she wrote that letter
And oh, I don't why she wrote that letter
And oh, I just don't know
And oh-oh baby
And out of the dark walked a strange man
And Phil Spector really has it all
And so they say
And somehow baby
And still it begins, needles and pins
And still life goes on;
And that would never end
And that's the way it's got to be
And the fish won't bite
And the night when the cold wind blows
And the night when the wolves cry out
And the night, when the moon is bright
And the nights are long
And the number thirteen
And then a little bit o' soul
And then I knew I wanted to die
And then I knew it was the end of her
And then I'll screw
And then she spoke aren't you someone I used to know
And then you had, had enough
And there are new thoughts Ready and waiting to explode
And there's a new voice Sayin' "we're not afraid to die"
And there's nowhere to go
And there's nowhere to run to
And these words I'm tellin' you
And they both got drunk
And they walk
And they're going to the discotheque a go go
And they're going to the Discotheque Au Go Go
And things were looking very grim
And things will never ever be the same again
And thinking just of you
And this time I think it's forever
And though I'm really tryin'
And times were very hard
And to take yourself out would really be a sin
And we want it now
And we went down to the dance
And we're goin' Surf City, 'cause it's two to one
And we've met all kinds of guys and girls
And weren't we lovers a long time ago?
And when I get to Surf City, I'll be shootin pearl
And when I saw you by
And when it stopped, she was holding hands with me
And when life get so-oh-oh hard
And when she winked, I gave that girl a hug
And when you raise the roof
And where did all the fun songs go
And will to survive
And with your love, I know with all my heart I can win
And you don't come close
And you feel like cryin'
And you know I told you so
And you're broke in two
And you're the only girl
And your friends baby they treat you like a guest
And your mind is full of red

As long as I've got you around
As planned, yeah, baby
As they possessed my house

At 90 miles an hour, that's why I saw my life - oh, oh

But do these things for no one else
But don't tell me that we won't have fun
But first I have to get in shape
But he wanted just a little bit more
But how I ever let he go
But how I ever let her go
But I can't stand to see her cryin'
But I don't love you anymore
But I dont love you anymore..
But I get down on my knees and I pray
But I guess that it just can't be that way
But I had a good time
But I just wanna have some fun
But I know all about your dirty tricks now
But I know I can do it
But I proved that I'm no sissy
But I see a street crazy shivering with cold
But I see an old lady with a shopping bag
But I told her why we just can't make it
But I was getting older
But I'll have my fun
But I'll make friends with anyone
But I'll treat you like I should
But I'm a substitute for another guy
But I'm just diggin' a Chinese ditch
But I'm still the same
But I'm tired of the hurt
But if you must act up
But in my heart I'll always be true
But in my heart I'll always love you
But in your head baby I'm afraid you don't know where it is
But isn't it always that way?
But it hurts so bad
But it still gets me where I wanna go
But it's not gonna happen
But it's not my place
But it's not my place oh no
But nothing can change the shape of things to come
But nothing seems to phase me and this one still survives
But now I finally know
But please realise you'll probably be surprised
But she just couldn't stay
But she never got there
But she wouldn't do what I wanted her
But she'll never get out of there
But that can't happen and everybody knows it's true
But that's not how I want it to be
But then my lover exposes me
But then they don't
But there ain't nothing that you can do
But they took her away
But they're looking good again
But things aren't what they seem
But things don't last forever
But times have changed
But until things blow
But we all know what went wrong
But we can't go surfin'
But we know it all too well
But what'd ya do?
But who's gonna briing home the loot?
But why are they alive
But why don't you go upset yourself
But you can't come back and be the first in line, on no
But you'll never get out of there
But you're a flop
But you're really a dummy

He braked for the light
He jumped down, he knocked her off her feet
He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up

He's a prehistoric man
He's go so many problems

I saw it happen with my own eyes
I say baby, baby I'm all screwed up
I see right through your plastic mac
I see words I can't describe
I shot some dope, I feel so sick
I should've been rich
I smoked my first cigarette at ten
I sprinkled cocaine on the floor
I stood under the moonlight to ill-luminate myself
I take you girl as you're standing there

I think I may start cryin'
I think I told you so
I think I'll try and phone her

I Wanted Everything
I wanted to go
I wanted to go but couldn't take it no more
I was a Green Beret in Viet Nam
I was born on a roller coaster ride
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
I was feeling sick
I was loosing my mind
I was ready to pack it up
I was so sad and blue I could feel any pain
I was worried about everything my head began to howl
I went out today for a walk in the rain
I will give it to you
I wish I could take the pain away
I wish I was dead
I wish I was someone else
I wish that time could go by fast
I won't be sad about it
I won't let it happen
I would think it was
I would think it was true

I've already had all my fun
I've always been able to laugh at fate
I've become a mental case
I've become irrational
I've been crushed by tumbling tide
I've been in the closet and feel all right
I've been loved, pushed (put) aside
I've been thinking it over
I've done all that I can do
I've gone mental
I've got my Mossberg 590
I've got this feeling that's inside of me
I've gotta have your love every day
I've killed my family
I've lived your life for so many years
If I don't start cryin' it's because that I have got no eyes
If I was stupid or naive
If people weren't such dicks and I never made mistakes
If rock is gonna stay alive
If she can find a reason to forgive
If there's one thing that makes me sick
If we don't stop this crazy carrying on
If you are, I hope that you can see
If you don't like me, I really don't care
If you got me, I like you girl
If you think it's a pack of lies
If you think you can, well come on man
If you want your love to last
If you're my victim you're beaten
Ignorance Is Bliss
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you
Ignorance is bliss, ya know it's true
Im Affected
In a bottle of formaldehyde
In a crazy world
In a German town
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
In a suit and in a tie
In East Berlin, ow-ooo
In every breath and step I take
In my lonely room I'd sit my mind in an ice cream cone
In old 'Frisco
In real good shape I have no fear
In the 9 to 5 world
In the bar or out on the street
In the chill of the night
In the garden of serenity
In the instant that I preach
In the institution
In the morning, I'm at work at time
In the park
In the tunnel of love
In the warm California sun
Indian Giver, Indian Giver
Infatuation, she's a fatal attraction
Intoxicated by the orchids abandoned in the garden
Involved in a robberry
Is compromise solution
Is driving me insane oh-yeah
Is he strong?
Is it a crime to be old
Is it goin' anywhere?
Is just as hard as stone
Is just no place for a street fighting man!
Is like the other girls you see
Is little girl won't you
Is my good luck charm
Is that some kind of warning to protect me?
Is there a chance for peace
Is there hope for the world today
Is this just some crazy dream
Is this real or just a dream
Is this what the future will bring
Is try to put the hurt on me
It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow
It always rings when I'm alone
It crushed my baby
It did not look like it came from Japan
It disturbs me so
It doesn't matter 'cause we're already late
It doesn't taste like wine
It don't matter what they say
It feels like somebody put something
It first felt like at thrill ride
It isn't easy to explain
It just took a few years
It keeps me edgy and mean
It landed in a field in Idaho
It leaves me with a bitter taste
It looked like an angel as she died in my prayers
It makes me fell allright
It makes me so damn angry
It makes me think of how things used to be
It makes me think of you
It makes me throw up in the toilet bowl
It makes no sense until I'm tense
It really makes you crazy
It really starts movin', yeah!
It turns out it was her mother
It was a long ago
It was dreaming and fantasy
It was glowing, glowing, glowing
It was something that I didn't think was so bad
It was sparkling, sparkling, sparkling
It was the face of love, and I knew
It's a genuine problem you won't try
It's a hopeless life, I hate it, hate it
It's A Long Way Back
It's a long way back to Germany 
It's a sick world, sick, sick, sick
It's a sick world, what can I say?
It's all or nothin' baby
It's alright
It's an abstract world you're an
It's getting bigger every day
It's getting easier than ever
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright, uh, huh
It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK, yeah, yeah
It's gonna be that you're the only ones who understand
It's gonna be the death of me
It's gonna be the death of you
It's gonna be the end you see
It's hot as a bitch
It's important if I wanna live
It's just a trained reaction something they gotta say... yeah
It's just for play
It's just like being in the navy
It's my only friend
It's Not For Me To Know
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know
It's not gonna happen
It's not hard, not far to reach
It's not me
It's Not My Place
It's not too late
It's not too late, yeah!
It's nothin' gonna happen nothin' ever will
It's our time
It's over
It's really killing me
It's the drugs and the lies and the ripoff bet?
It's the end, the end of the 70's
It's the end, the end of the century
It's the way it will be
It's the year of the monkey, gonna be real funky
It's true, it's true
It's TV's fault why I am this way
It's un-American policy
It's us against them
It's way past midnight
It's when someone tries to hide behind politics
It's you, yeah, baby
Its coming,.its coming,.its coming
Its gonna be all right tonight

Mankind's almost out of luck
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin
Maybe they should
Maybe you can give her more
Maybe you're just looking for a good time
Maybe you've got too much cash
Me mom and daddy
Meet a girl like you
Meet me in the graveyard
Memories make me cry
Memories make us cry
Mental Hell
Mental..
Mercenary, fight for anyone
Merry Christmas (I Don't Want To Fight Tonight)
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight with you
Merry Christmas, merry merry merry Christmas
Might get burned up by the sun
Misfits, twilight zone
Miss personality, a grade 'a' student naturally
Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones
Mom and pop wanna put me away
Mom threw out the glue
Mommy's on pills
Mommy, Daddy, can I please come home
More troubles are gonna come
Mosquitoes are happy tonight
Most desired dreams
Moving much too fast
Mr. Programmer
Mu love has blown away
Music playin' that portable sound
Mutiny from stern to bow
My arms were flying up, like a rocket ship
My baby's alive
My Back Pages
My boss he tells me that I'm doing fine
My brain is hanging upside down
My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes To Bitburg)
My brain is stuck from shooting glue
My brain was pulsating, I was battered and sore
My brain was racin but my feet wouldn't fly
My brain was racin but my feet wouldn't go
My brain was racin but my feet wouldn't scream
My brand new suit's really made out of sack
My faith was so much stronger then
My father was a soldier then
My father's in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized
My favorite song too, baby
My feet won't stop
My future's bleak
My girlfriend cryin' in the shower stall
My heart can't wait an other day
My heart stood still and skipped a beat
My heart trembles, I call your name
My history's written on me in tattoed ink
My little headcase, yeah
My mom and dad are always fighting
My my kind of a girl
My pathway led by confusion boats
My poor discarded baby
My poor old-fashioned baby
My rage turns to insane lust
My skull he's bleaching in the dust
My tears have come and gone
Nagging 'about the sound
Nancy was a broken queen
Near some cats but dogs don't bark
Needle and pins, needle and pins, needle and pins
Needles and Pins
Never ever go away
Never let you laugh or smile, not you
Never never can tell
New York beauty take my breath away
New York city is a real cool town
New York City, N.Y.C
Next time I'll listen to my heart
Next time, well I'll be smart
Nights intoxicating
No Christmas cards to send
No Go
No it's not my not my not my place
No it's not my place no no
No matter what
No matter what they say
No matter what you do
No more christmas or trick or treat
No more gangster
No more narco
No more of your fairy stories
No one cares, nobody knows
No one could help me
No one ever thought this one would survive
No one see the truth
No one seemed to notice seeing from smoke screen eyes
No one seems to notice
No time to cop
No tip for the delivery
No where to go
No, I can't take it
No, I can't take it no more
No, I don't wanna see your face no more
No, I have no home
No, it's not hard, not far to reach
No, no, no, no, why'd she have to go-oh-oh-oh
Nobody wants them now the kids are alright
Nobody wants you, nobody wants you
Nobody's my friend
Not again
Not much of a salary
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
Nothin' to do and no where to go-o-o I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do and no where to go-o-oh I wanna be sedated
Nothing ever seems to turn out right
Nothing I tried would satisfy
Nothing makes any sense, but I still try my hardest
Nothing to gain
Nothing wanted to grow
Nothing was on T.V
Nothing's right till it's all wrong
Now all I've got is sorrow and pain
Now I am a real sickie
Now I am telling you why
Now I don't know
Now I got glowing eyes
Now I guess I'll have to tell 'em
Now I know the score
Now I Wanna be a Good Boy
Now I wanna be all alone
Now I wanna be on my own
Now I wanna be sad alone
Now I wanna have somethin' to do
Now I wanna run away from home
Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue
Now I wanna wrestle in the garden
Now I'm a guide for the CIA
Now I'm beginning to feel the strain
Now I'm hangin' too
Now I'm in 7th heaven
Now I'm lookin' out my window but I don't know
Now I'm on the Bowery
Now it on my sweaty clothes
Now she's hanging out
Now she's lying
Now she's lying in a pool of blood
Now that you're gone, I feel the pain
Now the cops are after me
Now the time has come
Now things are better
Now until forever
Now when you're feelin' low
Now when you're in a mess
Now when your girl has gone
Now who the hell
Now wild hair is back in style
Now you say you wanna do my laundry
Now you say you wanna live with me
Now you're never gonna see her no more
Nowhere (place) to run
O o o o o o
Of an insane rage
Of fine German steel
Of the killer's knife
Of the minimum wage
Of the poor man's struggle
Oh baby
Oh baby, baby I just love her so
Oh baby, do you wanna dance
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?
Oh I don't know why
Oh I just don't know
Oh I thought I was smart, I stole her heart
Oh I'm so glad I found you
Oh my my my
Oh no
Oh no ho
Oh no no
Oh no no no no no
Oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no no
Oh no no, oh no no, oh yeah

Oh Oh I Love Her So
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh tell me that you feel
Oh that's how it begins, she'll feel those needle and pins
Oh yeah
Oh yeah that's what you said
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, uh-oh
Oh yeah-well all right
Oh'Lord I got to run
Oh, bartender, please
Oh, but I can't wait
Oh, I believe in miracles
Oh, I couldn't care what you think of me
Oh, I don't know why
Oh, I'm my main man
Oh, my sweet darling, what have I done
Oh, oh I love her so
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-ho oh-ho
Oh-no-no-no-no-no-no-no
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-wo-wo
Oho-ho-ho, we got nowhere to go
Oi-Oi-Oi-Oi
On a journey to the end
On a midnight odyssey
On automatic it's guaranteed hit
On my last leg just gettin' by
On no ho
On the boulevard where police hide
On the coaster and around again
On the couch with my special one
On the highest trails above
Oncoming car went out of control
One bullet in the cylinder
One crisis after another
One of us
One-two-three, you wanna have a family
One-two-three-four
One... Two... Three... Four!
Only thing that you regret
Ooh, baby baby, whatever you do now
Ooh, I love the way that you shake your hips, oh yeah
Ooh, now I know I'm so much in love
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah, my little headcase, yeah
Oohh!
Oohh...oohh..
Ooo-ooo-whee!
Ooo-whee, do it one more time for me!
Oooh, little Ramona
Ooooh, baby, yeah we sure felt fine
Oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah!
Open up the medicine chest
Or a lump on my head
Other countries are just as bad
Our heads were so achey
Our jails are filled to the max
Our playground is a pharmacy
Our troubles never end
Out against my will
Out of bed at 6:15 In a rush and you can't think
Out of more aggravation
Out of the hospital
Out of there without a doubt
Out Of Time
Out on the coast
Outside of everything
Outsider
Outta my mind
Over my shoulder, I keep looking back
Pain more painful and laughter much louder, yeah
Paint the face of a demon, glowing by the fire light
Palisades Park
Paradise is just in sight
Past the edge of Disneyland
Past the end of Disneyland
Peace and love is here to stay
People - always tellin' lies, they can keep their alibi
People - knockin' at my door, how come they want more and more
People - starrin' at your clothes - I can't take it anymore
People - talkin' behind your back, most of them drive a cadilac
Perhaps they'll die
Pet Sematary
Pick up the pieces
Picked up the magazine, I see your face
Pickin' the banana
Pinhead
Planes are landing
Planet Earth 1988
Plays an old loud drum
Please help me man
Please me
Poison heart
Police are every place
Politicians (to confuse you)
Poppin' phenobarbitol
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Powerful and strong like King Kong
Pranks and muggings are fun
Presents under a Christimas tree
Pretty mean when it wants to be
Probably never live to get old
Probably won't see no money
Proud 'neath heated brow
Psycho therapy
PT-boat on the way to Havana
Pulsating to the back beat
Punishment Fits The Crime
Punk punk a punk rocker
Punk punk, a punk rocker
Push me around
Questioningly
Questioningly her eyes looked at me
Questioningly her eyes looked at me..
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
R-A-M-O-N-E-S, R-A-M-O-N-E-S
R.A.M.O.N.E.S
Radio playin' so no one can see
Rainy days rain cool wine
Ramona
Ramones are hangin' out in Kokomo
Ran out of Carbona
Ran out of paint and roach spray too
Record player on
Record stores and interviews
Remember what I say 'bout
Ride a hurricane
Riding in my head
Ring me, ring me ring me
Ring me, ring me, ring me
Rock all night
Rock N Roll High School
Rock Rock Rockaway Beach
Rock'n, rock'n'roll radio Let's go
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll high school
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock'n'roll high school
Rock-n-roll's alive 'cause we got the power baby
Rockaway Beach
Roger Corman's on a talk show
Rollin' high and mighty traps
Romantic facts of musketeers
Run around, run around
Russians and Americans war machine
S&L deficit, the homeless, the environment
Sacrifice and sacrilege
Sadness turns to fun
Said she's going to L.A
Said we'd be together
Satan's watching
Say hey-hey-hey is Arty home
Say that you'll let me have this dance?
Say you're a victim of society
Say your prayers-it's your only hope
Scattergun, scattergun, scattergun
Scattergun, steal from me there'll be no time to run
Schocked how deadly we fight back
Screaming, shouting, wham-slam-bam
Second rule is: Be nice to mommy
Second verse, same as the first
See me silently quietly creep
See through you like cellophane
Seems that folks turn into things
Selling Daddy's dope
Send you all my love
Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Shaking hands with your highness
Shaky lock and kicky door
She always wants to come over
She Belongs To Me
She came from a happy home
She caught him with another
She don't talk to me
She drives me crazy, oh yeah
She eats Thorazine in her farina
She had a very bad affair
She had it all in place
She had it all worked out
She had to break away
She looks a so fine
She looks so happy but she seems so sad
She looks so sweet
She makes my heart go flippity flap
She makes my heart spin like a tilt-a-whirl
She never got there
She never got there, they say
She said, "there's something about you
She says come over, it's alright
She says she's babysitting tonight
She says they're quiet except for one little creep
She smiled at me as I held her carefully
She talks to birds ..
She talks to birds she talks to angels
She Talks To Rainbows
She talks to trees
She talks to trees she talks to bees
She told me told me told me told me
She turned into a head of lettuce
She was a really good friend
She was brown, and I was pretty green
She was contemplating suicide
She was everything to me
She was everything to me oh yeah
She was everything to me, oh yeah
She was going to the wash and dry
She was outside hitchin' a ride
She was standing by the Space Invaders
She was wavin', wavin' bye bye
She went away for the holidays
She went to see if the kids were asleep
She wouldn't do it for me
She wouldn't go far
She wouldn't make it alive
She'll never get out of there
She's a cool kind of crazy
She's a little lost girl in her own little world
She's a punk punk, a punk rocker
She's A Sensation
She's going to get left behind
She's here, right here on the altar
She's still cryin', she ain't tryin'
She's the kind of girl that I love so
She's The One
She's the one, she's the one
She's the one, she's the one, she's the one
She's worth to him than me, let her go ahead
Sheena is a Punk Rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Shines a friendly hello
Ships are docking
Shock treatment, I'm doing fine
Shoot'em in the back now
Shootin' up poison, and livin' in hell
Should have to do
Should I take a chance on her?
Shouldn't wish you happiness, wish her the very best
Sick, sick, sick, it's the price I pay
Sid and Nancy meant a lot to me
Sid and Nancy were a mess
Sid and Nancy were born to lose
Sid never meant any harm
Sid was a punk rock king
Sinking into the stars
Siting here in Queens
Sitting all alone by the telephone
Sitting here thinkin' only of you
Sitting here with nothin' to do
Sitting In My Room
Sitting on my window sill
Skeletons dance, I curse this day
Skies were cloudy everyday
Slam danced to a rockin' band
Sleep all day
Slugs and snails are after me
Smile on his face
Smiles in the sky
Smokey air that I adore
Smooth bore, scattergun, scattergun, scattergun
Smooth bore, scattergun, you are the only one
Snorting up some speed on the picture of St. Peters
Snowball fighting, it's so exciting baby
So beautiful
So don't be sad cause I'll be there
So I know I'll never be free
So I picked up the phone
So I said can I see you later
So if you can, please understand
So if you have to go then you'd better go now
So if you're coming get ready to go
So much damn confusion before my eyes
So we took the car downtown
So why you wanna walk around with me?
So you better relax
So you think it's funny
Soak them wet with your tears
Soaring like a superhero
Society really brings me down
Some honeys will be coming along
Some kind of employment
Some one please help me
Somebody calls me on the phone
Somebody like me
Somebody put something
Somebody Put Something In My Drink
Somebody put something...in my drink...in my drink...in my drink..
Somebody To Love
Somehow they manage to make it last
Somehow we get all these creeps in control
Someone caught one I could see so myself
Someone cries, something ain't right
Someone had to pay the price
Someone has to pay the price
Someone is holding a grudge
Someone told me long ago, there's a calm before the storm
Someone's gonna have to pay
Something I fell into from being kicked around
Something started crawling on me
Something To Believe In
Something to do soon
Something's always goin' wrong
Sometimes I feel I just can't win
Sometimes I feel like screamin
Sometimes I feel like screaming
Sometimes I feelin' my soul is as restless as the wind
Song of mine
Sonny Bono and Jack Nitzsche
Sound check's at 5:02
Southern winds, shining rays
Spaceship travels at the speed of light
Spain, New Zealand, and the U.S.A
Sparking in the night
Specialize in having fun
Spend my time in a cold jail cell
Spiderman, Spiderman
Spins a web any size
Spirits moaning among the tombstones
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Squeeze me baby all through the night
Stalking the street till the break of day
Stalking the streets till the break of day
Standing here in front of the mirror
Standing on the street
Standing out here in the rain
Staring at the goldfish bowl
Started having second thought I was scared as hell
Stay around in my old hometown
Stay away from danger
Stay away from her, 'cause it's making me angry
Stick 'em up
Still how i ever ever let her go
Still pushing a mop
Stop this crazy carrying on
Stopping for my usual seat
Straight as an arrow
Straight on through to the break of day
Stranded in the sweet wonderings
Street Fighting Man
Street lamps make the bussing sound
Strength to endure
Substitute
Substitute me for him
Substitute my Coke for gin
Substitute you for my Mum
Substitute your lies for facts
Subway creaking down below
Sugar-plum fairies dancing in their heads
Summer fun, with the Beach Boys on
Suppose I'll always be a worm
Surf City
Surfin' Bird
Surfin' Safari
Suzy is a Headbanger
Swallow my pride
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Sweet little girl
Sweet Mary Jane
Sweet sweet little Ramona
Take a look overhead
Take a ride to the land inside and you'll see
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind
Take his love instead, and one day she will see
Take it as it comes
Take it easy baby
Take it, Dee Dee
Take my hand
Take The Pain Away
Take what you want and I'll do what I have to do
Take your love and send it to me
Talks to the rainbows and to the seas
Taste my blood
Tattooed your name on my arm
Taxi in the distance coming along
Tear me limb from limb
Tears are running ah running down your breast
Teenage Lobotomy
Tell me baby I'm your lover man
Tell me that you feel
Tell me that you feel the same
Tell me what you're doing this for
Tell me why is it always this way?
Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me please, if psychiatric help is what we need
Tell me, tell me, what's so wrong, if humans just got along
Tell me, tell me, who's to blame, for people acting this way
Texas chain saw massacre
Thank You
Thank you. We've got a little tear jerker for you lonely hearts out
That ain't no lie
That girl could still be mine
That I got no cerebellum
That I got no mind to lose
That I once may have knew
That just stinks...it's not for me
That you must have some doubts
That you used to tell me
That's alright by me
That's not what any kid
That's the attitude that isn't fun
That's the breaks, it's the chance you take
That's the way it will be
That's what they wanna give me
That's when I knew it was the end of her
That's where the girls are
That's where you must be
That, I feel the way I do
The best girl in the whole wide world
The best poison of
The big bright moon
The bitter end
The Blitzkrieg Bop
The bubble's going to explode
The bucketful
The circuits are exploding
The coolest chick on the whole East Coast
The crash, shattering glass
The Crusher
The dangers, its the dangers of love
The footprints on (the sign the time)
The future's comin' in, now Sweet and strong
The future's here today
The girl I sat with almost, almost puked
The heart is the place devils congregate
The iceman comes a lot
The irony it semes it seems to me
The job that ate my brain
The jukebox, ow-ow
The kids all come from miles around
The kids are losing their minds
The kids were dancing
The kids were hanging out all around
The KKK Took My Baby Away
The last thing I wanted was to hear them ring the bell
The love we had was true
The moon is full, the air is still
The morning is near
The North side of my town faced East and the east was facing South
The one your parents despise
The only thing I wanted to say
The only thing to live for is today..
The only things you do
The party gets started when the sun goes down
The philosophy of (warish crime)
The plaster fallin' off the wall
The pleasures of a journey to the center of the mind
The problems just keep piling in
The Return of Jackie and Judy
The rich are laughing at the poor
The room has changed today
The rooms were so much colder then
The run around
The Shape Of Things To Come
The simple things you see are all complicated
The sirens, and pain
The smell of death is all around
The solution to peace isn't clear
The soviets really make me mad
The spirits are angry
The sun is out and I want some
The sun, the earth the moon my baby
The terrorist threat is a modern fear
The terrorists threat is a modern fear
The things she said, well, maybe they're true
The time has come we oughta break it
The time is right
The van is making me crazy
The way I wanna be
Their lives were so glamorous
Then around, like a merry-go-round
Then he knocked her on the floor
Then I can find a reason to live
Then I could find forgiveness
Then I did what God forbade
Then I said I love too
Then I took out my razor blade
Then we made a promise
Then we went down to Coney Island
Then you took a hold of my hand
There ain't not place for me
There are changes Lyin' ahead in every road
There are millionaires with more than they need
There are new dreams Crowdin' out old realities
There are no jobs for the young
There are things to realize
There goes the Spiderman
There is no future for the youth
There is no hope for the young
There she goes again
There was beer in the soda machine
There was no Mom or Daddy
There was troubles and I had'em too
There's a new sun Risin' up angry in the sky
There's danger on every corner but I'm okay
There's go to be a better way
There's just no place for a street fighting man!
There's money in the supermarket
There's no choice or difference
There's no hope
There's no one else like you
There's no stoppin' the cretins from hoppin'
There's no success for me
There's nothing scary to enjoy
There's nothing to gain
There's nothing wrong, hair of the dog
There's revolution Sweepin' in like a fresh new breeze
There's somethin' down there
There's the threat of the nuclear bomb
Theres no law, no law anymore
They all go out and drinkin all night
They blast out the disco on the radio
They both came up to New York
They both got caught for cutting
They both got kicked outside
They both went down to Berlin, joined the Ice Capades
They both went down to Frisco, joined the SLA
They do not care they do not care
They do their best, they do what they can
They don't like my friends
They fish
They fly
They get them ready for Viet Nam
They got complains about everything
They got their surfboards
They just wanna be so lame
They just wanna worry
They never really do
They say the answers are blowin' in the wind
They say they never roll the scoops
They say we don't listen anyway
They say you're just an awkward kid
They shoot their missiles in the air
They sin
They steal, they cheat, they take take take
They stood there ashamed with nowhere to go
They they loose their rights and they act surprised
They thought I was an oddity
They took her away
They took her from me
They took my baby away
They took my baby away from me
They took my girl
They turn to crime and turn to drugs
They want every drop
They want your blood
They went down to the Mudd Club
They're all reved up and ready to go
They're anglin' in Laguna in Cerro Azul
They're forming in a straight line
They're generating steam heat
They're going through a tight wind
They're gonna make a fuss
They're gonna want my autograph
They're kicking out in Dohini too
They're piling in the back seat
They're ready to go now
They're shooting the pier
They're telling us
They've got their surfboards
Things happen overnight
Things may never ever be the same again
Things will never ever be the same again
Thinkin' about
Third rule is: Don't talk to commies
Third verse, different from the first
This ain't a dream, I can't escape
This ain't the Stone Age
This Aint Havanna
This Business Is Killing Me
This could be the end
This could only happen to me
This cross isn't mine
This guy thinks he's the champion
This is a hungry world, there are months to feed
This is dedicated to our fans across the world
This is insanity
This is not good for my health
This kind of feeling could move a nation
This one more screwed up the nation
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
Through a crack of light I was unable to find my way
Through dragon mist
Through the distant blue
Through the fast lane
Through this darkness
Throw out the trash
Thunderin' like me tonight
Tie her to the alter, pull out her heart and eat her flesh
Till I walked you home
Time bomb
Time has come today
Time has come today, hey
Time to aim your arrows at the sun
Time to laugh, time to die
Time to live, time to lie
Time to walk, time to run
Times Square was approaching
Tipper, what's that sticker sticking on my CD?
Tired of complaints I am ready for fun
Tired of naggin' nothin's ever happenin'
Tired of tryin'
To a place called Palisades Park
To be with you tomorrow
To come
To cover me when I sleep
To cover me when I sleep, cover me in my dreams
To get a good job
To have some fun, to see what I could see
To him, life is a great big bang-up
To make you wanna love me so
To our fans far and near
To put you right
To Rockaway Beach
To see you through
To the cloudy lace
To the highest trails above
To the silent dark
To turn that racket down
To work it out at all, just pass it by, pass it by
To working 9 to 5
Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World
Told me that you love me And that you always will
Told that girl surrender to me
Tomorrow she goes away
Tomorrow she goes away - ay, hay
Tonight
Tonight it's gonna be alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight,tonight,tonight,tonight
Too many chocolates keep a fat man fat
Too many demons around here now
Too noble to neglect
Too Tough To Die
Took back the love you gave to me
Took off like a blast
Torn painted lips tasting the last drops of life
Tossed her in the bin
Touring
Touring touring, all around the world
Touring, touring, all around the world
Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, oh baby, touring
Touring, touring..
Tracks on my arms
Trapped inside a night but I'm a day and I go
Triple-O bucks the only shot for me
Troublemakers who attack
Try and sniff some glue
Try to expose you
Try to put me down
Tryin' to reach your goal
Trying to achieve what they all call contentness
TV set is on
Twelve apostles can't help you now
Twenty four hours ago
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go I wanna be sedated
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go..
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go...
Two brown eyes filled with hate
Uncle Floyd shows on the T.V
Under street lamps I will play
Under the arc of a weather stain boards
Until the early morning light
Up late light my chocolate sweet
Up on the roof, out on the street
Up the FBI
Up the President
Upbeat, Shinding and Ed Sullivan too?
Using ideas as my maps
Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away
Vin Scelsa's on the radio
Wait wait
Walking down the street trying to forget yesterday
Walking through a winter wonderland
Walking through the cross fire heart
Wanna kneel and pray
Want more action, haven't had my fill
Want my money back
Wart Hog
Wart, Wart Hog
Watch her headbangin'
Watch the watch the way i walk
Watching Get Smart on TV
Way down in the middle east
We accept you
We ain't got no friends
We can find a way
We can hitch a ride
We can't start kissing 'cause the kid's a little spy
We can't start kissing and I'll tell you why
We could go down to E Street, it doesn't matter ya know
We could go to a drive-in, it doesn't matter ya know
We danced around to a rockin' band
We drove each other crazy
We even at a hot dog stand
We fell in love by the soda machine
We got a fuel-injected tour bus, man it really flies
We got a lot of things to do now
We got no skirts to chase
We got no wheels to race
We got to get away
We got to stop this crazy carrying on
We had our last chance
We had some good tiimes and we had fun
We had some good times-we had fun
We know it's wrong
We know what we think of them
We need change, we need it fast
We ran into a miracle
We still believe in anarchy
We Want the Airwaves
We want the airwaves, baby
We want the world
We wanted to know how much trouble there was
We was young and in love

What a tragedy
What can I do
What can I say?
What can you do?
What can you do? (lose?)
What do you say?
What ever happend to the radio
What happens to me is my own affair
What makes you think she'll go with you
What makes you think you're better than me
What the neighbours say
What they want, I don't know
What went wrong she couldn't tell
What'd ya do?
What's good for them, now it ain't good for you
What's happening to our society?
What's she doin' now on the escalator
What's so wrong, hair of the dog
What's Your Game
When are you coming home
When he kicked me out
When I look in your eyes
When I look into her big brown eyes
When I look into your big brown eyes
When I saw her on the corner
When I saw her walking down the street
When I saw you at the Cat Club
When I saw you by the Peppermint Lounge
When I saw you on 8th street
When I see her on the street
When I see her on..
When I see the 5 oclock news
When I see the price that you pay
When I start movin, you see a blur
When I was a boy I thought about the times I'd be a man
When I Was Young
When I was young it was more important
When I was young..
When I was your age
When I woke up this morning from the night before
When I'm going home
When I'm lyin' in my bed at night
When I'm with you at night and we love
When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day
When life gets oh so frustrating
When my heart pants
When no one was watching
When the big bright moon
When the fireflies glow
When the folks are not around
When the garden flowers baby are dead yes
When the music's loud
When the truth is found to be lies
When they look me in the eye I turn the other way
When tomorrow is today The bells may toll for some
When troubles disappear
When we asked our daddy he said it's just because
When you gonna turn yourself in? Yeah
When you kiss me I just gotta
When you're hooked on heroin
When you're raised on andiet of bickering at hate
When's their time coming, man
Whenever there's a hang-up
Where fantasy is fact
Where I belong
Where is Rudolph? Where is Blitzen, baby?
Where is Santa? At his sleigh?
Where it came from, I don't know
Where my baby can be
Where my baby went
Where the California girls
Where the days are short
Where they walk
Where they're out there having fun
Where's your guts
Wherever you go
Which turned into a whole romance
Whiskey bottle movie on T.V
Who am I, am I to say
Who understand
Whoa baby, baby I just love her so
Why baby-why, why, why?
Why can't I stand up, and tell myself I'm strong
Why can't stop, and tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong
Why did you have to die?
Why do you want to talk to me for?
Why does it have to be this way
Why don't they understand
Why don't you get a hoola hoop
Why I can't let her go
Why is it always this way?
Wild and she's willing
Will come your way
Will destroy mankind's dream
Will the fighting ever cease
Will you remember Jerry Lee
Winter is here
Winter turns to summer
Wise guys never compromise
With 9 to 5 girl
With a brat like that always on your back
With a little bit o' soul
With a video tape deck inside
With Allan Arkush and Stephen King
With his gun
With lust like a Romeo
With our boards inside
With some cat from Hiroshima
With the lamest fashions on your back
With the President in the White House
With you rock and roll
With your covers pulled up over your head?
Without you baby's like suicide
Woke up thinking bout you today
Wonderin' how I ever willsee
Wondering what I'm doing tonight
Work them fingers to the bone

You are all the same jelly
You ask them for your mercy
You better find somebody to love
You better give up on my insistence
You better go now
You better know what you want

You can get what you want but I don't think it is true
You can go up, down, or sideways

You can't change a turd into gold
You can't come back and think you are still mine

You don't know what it's like
You don't know what you're doin' to me, aw yeah, oh yeah, oh
You don't know what you're doin' to me, aw yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
You don't know what's going on
You don't want a diamond ring - ay, hey, hey
You don't want money
You don't want to share with anyone else
You fill my heart with misery
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid
You fly around like a bee
You got (the rights) and there's always a temptation
You got a pocket of
You got all the buildings and the factories
You got all the money, you got all the wealth
You got all the power (and the ceremonies)
You got everything at home
You gotta come back
You gotta come back baby, come back
You gotta fight to make (your love into returns)
You gotta fight to stay independent
You gotta go go go go goodbye
You gotta have fun, not a fix in the arm
You gotta keep it beatin'
You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned
You gotta learn to listen, listen to learn
You gotta make like you
You gotta start hanging on to all your (affairs)
You gotta stay out of deep water
You gotta take the cotton out of your ears
You gotta wait
You gotta wait wait
You had me believing
You heard that I'm no good
You hinder it with emotion
You hold me so with this quick temptation
You just can't stop
You just have to cope and start over again
You know
You know how little I got
You know I had a good night
You know I need no alibi
You know if it comes true
You know she drives me outta my head
You know she drives me outta my mind
You know she makes my life complete
You know that life really takes its toll
You know we're comin' over
You know we're goin' Surf City, gonna have some fun
You know we're goin' Surf City, gonna have someone, now
You know you did
You know you like it
You know, it ain't very cherry, it's an oldie but a goody Surf City
You know, they're either out surfin' or they got a party growin Surf
You look like you're sick too
You look like your sick too
You looked really kind of cool
You looked really kind of cool now
You lose your imagination
You love wine like they love cash
You make it all worthwhile
You make me move, yeah, like no one else
You may be dead but your souls are free
You might not come back
You need a little bit o' soul
You need a proper schooling
You need more time to forget
You put a quarter in and played
You realize somehow, someway
You really did it your way
You said everything would be fine, oh no no
You said everything would be fine, oh no no no no
You said that you always be there, oh yeah!
You said that you'd be mine
You said that you'd be true
You said you never wanted me to go, oh no!
You say you want my lovin' more than any other thing - ay, hey, hey
You say you're poor and uneducated
You should have just let me walk by
You Should Have Never Opened That Door
You should never have opened that door
You Sound Like You're Sick
You take the money and you shoot it up
You thieving whore, you hustle for bucks
You think I'm real cute
You think my shoes are made of leather
You think we look pretty good together
You think you can read her mind
You think you took away my dream
You thought you were a clever girl
You told
You told me that was true
You took your love away from me
You tried and tried
You turn red with rage
You two made a pact of death
You used to make me happy
You used to make me the happiest guy in
You wanna go cop
You wanna go get some Chinese rock
You wanna play a game of cat and mouse
You wanna take a walk
You watch the world complain, but you do it anyway
You were just too young
You were lost but you've been found, baby
You work, you work
You write all night
You'll be miserable every day your luck will always be bad
You'll find the Spiderman!
You'll get a lot more kicks
You'll like it more and more
You'll never know how good it just can feel
You'll never understand, I'm in misery
You're a brat
You're a hopeless problem
You're a kid
You're a pain in the ass, and your on the (loose)
You're a politician
You're a styling queen and an alley cat
You're an ugly dog there's
You're definitions of obscenity
You're getting better and better
You're gonna be sorry if we have to fight
You're gonna get a blood bath
You're Gonna Kill That Girl
You're hangin' too
You're loudmouth baby
You're my-my kind of a girl
You're never happy, a hypochondriac
You're nothin' boy, a goddamn waste
You're obsolete my baby
You're on your way to life's promotion
You're out of touch, my baby
You're quite insane
You're the best, most loyalist, and that's for sure
You're the one they never pick
You're thirty five
You've been away for far too long
You've been moving much too fast
You've got me so that my nerves are breakin
You've got to pick up the pieces
Youn know it's generally known
Young hearts can go their way
Your destiny was planned from the very first day
Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his
Your knees would bend and your hair will curl
Your little girlfriend
Your low cut slacks and your long black hair
Your marshall law
Your slacks are low and your hips are showin
Youre Gonna Kill That Girl
Zero Zero UFO
