THE GOD SLEEPING
----------------
sacerdotis pietatis et noris
deus docent profanum faciger
encevali tribunalis et gabriel
laudemos lune

over the top of the mountain the god is getting sleep
faces, skulls around him don't make any noise
he will wake up, his anger will show his power

no, let's begin the war now
no, the beast is talking to you
no

between the earth and sky he will do his desire
between the water of see won't you stay seven days
you will live like a dog who is ordered to open the hell gates

no, let the hell raise on
no, it's me the beast who is talking to you

over the fire of hell god make his pleas
start pray no 'cus the end is near
over the burn of souls he smiles his teeth
start clean your soul now 'cus your judgement is here

when the moon spin the god will shout
when the sun extinguish the god will smike
when the ground go down the god will sing
when the war is over the god will sleep


FIGHT WITH MY MIND
------------------
i am in a constant fight with my mind
in all i think big trips i see passing in front of my eyes

i see the truth of my existence
my brain is torturing me and i can't do not to help me
but now i fantasy my self i am another i
i'm saved for a time, waiting for the next crises

the game
when you find someone to play the game
with you know how the hell can be
but you are invite to come with me
back to somewhere you never been
you hate you love and this is life
there's suffer and pain in paradise
you wake and see in front your eyes 
in blood this write, scream for your god

i bleed, i scream in silent nobody hear
how can i be protect, for something that is inside

i hear only the silence
i see only the darkness 
i lost my voice for the pain
of the memories coming again


A CAÇA
------
nascido nas sombras no frio das noites calmas
guardião da escuridão, dos becos e ruas da cidade
onde ele espera, a noite que está pra chegar
seus olhos brilharão e é tudo que você verá

lembre criança você é a caça
ela a ama mas nunca se mostrará
quando os cães uivarem nas ruas
tenha certeza que ele perto estará

a sua inocência é um desejo
ele a está seguindo onde quer que vá
apenas a vítima indefesa
sem que ele ouse tocá-la nunca
pois se você acordar
a inocência e a magia podem acabar
quando seus olhos virarem para lua
reflexo de uma visão selvagem e crua

quando passa por mim você consegue sentir
nossos olhos se cruzam você consegue lembrar
minhas garras a cortarão, não posso permitir
que as memórias ressurjam no seu coração


GUILTY BY OMISSION
------------------
why people don't face each other
excuse to cover their own secrets
running over their veins
'cus eyes are windows to see
the feelings they have indide
sad or happy is just a lie
maybe i'm a strange maybe i am blind
trying to penetrate your mind
and find your reality
sculptured faces for diferent heads
are reflections of inside

can you face me listen my true
your best friend or the worse enemy
and you stay blind for my existence
i'm inside of you if you want talk to me
just face the mirror you gonna find
the phantom of reallity

when i'm walking in the streets 
i see the bodies passing and heads are going
sculptured faces, head by head
made exactly for that one
pictures of life
faces are mirrors and eyes are windows
to see their feelings
you gonna find pictures of life
an album  full of pictures of 

life is what you want lies is what you have
can't you see the truth or you just don't care
about the price you pay here
mind masturbation, frustration is a lost orgasm
you are a book and i'm reading your fears

you can't face me but i am your true
your sadness, your madness
and you stay blind for all your sins
i'm inside of you to show your misery
just face the mirror, you gonna find
what makes you guilty
