MILHOUSE "learn your virtual love" (rio de janeiro - RJ - Brasil)


O GNOMO
-------
now you realize that your time has passed by
like darkness, blind like an old guy
and now you start to think about
what you've done, what you've lost
you start to realize when you start to think about
that your life has passed by, you life was thrown away

in the middle of nowhere
now you realize that no one cares
in the middle of nowhere
there's a light that no one cares

now you open your eyes
and you can see no reason why
you don't understand why they are calling your name
they say you're a coward
they call you a coward
your strenght is gone


STUPID
------
sometimes i hate myself
just like the other night
when it happened again

i would like to stay with you
but i was quiet and shy
then i lost you once more

i won't be so stupid anymore
i won't stay alone anymore

well, i decided i should drink
to get heart to talk to you
but, drunk, i couldn't speak

i did many silly things
you must think that i'm a jerk
sometimes i think i really am


I DON'T KNOW
------------
do you believe the way i do?
can you believe the way i go?
imagine people according to
imagine people dying for

everytime i see
everytime i go
this time i must be mad
this night i must be low

is it a faction? don't follow me
this is the way you gotta be
a fascination that i can't see
the conversation that i must leave

everytime i see
everytime i go
this time i must be mad
this night i must be low

that i don't know

this time i see fighting
this way i get dying
the way i want to know
the way i want to know


INSANE DREAM
------------
never carry out your insane dreams
and you're looking for someone to hit me
and you know there's a why
for the things we do it right
and you there's a better place to live

you and me, an insane dream
and you know there's a why
for the things we do it right
you and me, an insane dream
and you're looking for someone


BLOWING IN THE WIND
-------------------
"a resposta, meu amigo, está soprando no vento"


THIEVES IN THE STREET
---------------------
yesterday morning
i was on the street
three little kids came to me
they ask about money
but i didn't have
they took my wallet
and there was a check
i went to a p.d.the cops asked to me
about the three boys, i said "i don't know"
but i have a hope to go outta there
and find them in somewhere...
thieves in the streets
they gotta be killed?


ERRAND 
------
hey pretty girl, listen to me
you're not the best thing we've ever seen
you think your beauty is such a gun
hey strong boy, you're a joke
hitting the weakers anywhere you go
would you do it without your gang?
treating people just like shit
i wanna know if you really think
that you're better than someone
hey rich man, buy everything
but power's not what money means
and you don't live in the wonderland
hey, hey you
authority
your rules don't mean nothing to me
please, tell me, when will it make some sense?


CHANGE
------
in my city the children can't play
and the population is so afraid
what's going on?
violence and robbery everywhere
you can't stay alone
you can be the next one
so, let's try to change it now, we don't need this war
let's open our fuckin' eyes and try to clear this mistake
and you think you can do nothing
just open a beer and smoke some blunt
but this is not the salvation, it's just a way to forget
don't be a hypocrite, we need everyone's help


OUTBREAK
--------
millions of people, those people are dyin'
the reports of cases began to surface
there's no cure, the people are crying
we can believe and stop this disgrace
we don't know how prevent this disease
to heal all everywhere
we get more rebellious, we get more relligious
but we don't like to share
there's a cure for this disgrace, but we don't want to know
your life is changing and following your body
you out of control and living by meyour
life is landing and the pain is your mentor
you've been so weak and so blind to see
melting all the organs and causing bleeding from everywhere
providing a traditional funeral
require handling, prepare the body for a burial


CRAZY
----- 
i'm known as a crazy guy
and i don't know why they say
that i'm completely nuts, getting mad and going insane
that's why i'm a skateboarder?
that's why i don't like school?
that's why i don't follow fashions?
that's why i'm not like you?
that's why i'm always laughing?
that's why i do not lie?
that's why i'm really happy?
that's why i got my own life?
i'm known as a crazy guy
i don't know why, i don't know why
i'm known as a crazy guy
when i just do what i like
that's why i play as a child?
that's why i always dare?
that's why my band plays too loud?
that's why i just don't care?


LEARN YOUR LOVE
---------------
what i said to my religion, what i feel into my vision
i can't find the magic to true love
in the eyes i saw the hunger, in the night i can't decide
i think i'm bad but i won't go to hell
i don't need your love, i'll try to find other
please don't come back, forget all the things i have
now i know you're shit, go to hell and fuck in it
find the other man and try to learn your love
i'll be a better man, without you and your great hand
my true life will never fade again
but i think you're here, what a hell i want to be
i can't forget your existence was here


RAPHAELLIUS 
-----------
mouro ou buda?
eu não sei não!
eu conheço uma figura, ele é muito engraçado
se amarra em cachorro, ele é alienado
o seu nome é raphaellius e pega todas menininhas
ele é um bodyborder, nem perdoa as criancinhas
ele foi muito funkeiro, mas agora se curou
ia sempre no subúrbio, onde quase se matou
ele era muçulmano, mas agora ele mudou
acredita no buda, como ele me falou
