today (20020321) SedSokoban was slashdotted
<http://slashdot.org/developers/02/03/21/0217219.shtml?tid=127>

in one of the comments, Wispers_in_the_dark posted his solution for
level 1, it's on dolevel1.txt file.

to execute it, just pass this file to the sed script:

   prompt$ ./sokoban.sed dolevel1.txt
or
   prompt$ cat dolevel1.txt | ./sokoban.sed
or
   prompt$ ./sokoban.sed < dolevel1.txt
or
   ...

so, what about a tiny-solution contest?
this one has 200 moves.
