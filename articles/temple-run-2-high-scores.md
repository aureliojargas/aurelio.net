Temple run 2 

Don't waste time worrying about hi scores unless you have maxed all the power ups.

Focus in getting the most coins first.

And completing the objectives to increase your level.

First max out the double and triple coins power (Coin Value). Those triple coins since 2000 meters make a HUGE difference in your coin count.

Change the character power up from shield to coin magnet. You it every time the power meter is maxed. Don't waste gems in improving it, since it only lasts for the next run. Increase the Power Meter power to allow faster recharges.

If your died from 2000 and far, it's a good idea the resurrect using one gem. Your speed will slow down and in a few seconds in you'll collect hundreds of coins because of the triple coins everywhere. Even the next two gems resurrect may be a good deal for you.

Also increase the Save Me power to spend less gems when resurrecting.


1. Unlock triple coins.
2. Collect the most coins and objectives to max all power ups.
3. Now you can focus in hi scores.
