## Jekyll and txt2tags

Instead of Markdown, these articles use the [txt2tags](http://txt2tags.org) markup. It's similar, but it has some additional features, such as [automatic Table of Contents (TOC)](http://txt2tags.org/userguide/toc.html), auto numbered headings, author notes (which do not appear in the final document) and advanced regular expressions filters to modify the [input](http://txt2tags.org/userguide/preproc.html) and [output](http://txt2tags.org/userguide/postproc.html) texts.

There's [a plugin](https://github.com/txt2tags/plugins/tree/master/Jekyll) to make Jekyll support txt2tags files.
