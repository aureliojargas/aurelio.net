IMORTAL "keep up the flame" (brasília - DF - Brasil)


CLOSE TO THE EDGE
-----------------
i hold my breath now as i'm trying to survive
i fear for the day, what if nothing is alive?
i can feel my heart, not for too long
will i wake up in the place that i belong?

in the end there's a light but i know it ain't right
i look all around and ask who am i
i'll get back my strength from a source that i will find
up with the power there's no need to hide

close to the edge, it gets really near
chasm i'll pass over
killing my fear

change the season, change the sky
oh! the sadness it could die
hold the next, our chance to live
and the rest we can forgive

refrão

i'll try a little longer to  make my voice some stronger
so up from this day, wake up from this bad dream

refrão


BLACK FATE
----------
when the night darkens the day
everything seems to be so calm
nobody would ever tell what our life keeps for us
in their lives they have the certainty
that tomorrow the sun is gonna rise
but nothing will ever last forever
and maybe tomorrow no one will be alive

the world spins around and suffer
it's the agony of pollution
that slowly, day after day kills the life and brings the darkness
men take all the blame and still call himself "the rational being"
we're killing each other, we are brothers
we're getting close to the end

you don't even seem to care go on living and just don't worry
takes the life from the earth, makes the war to subdue
but don't get deceived with so much richness
i know someday the earth will get even
and the war in the world, men against men
there will be nothing left, nothing left

now the bombs start to fall, everything begins to explode
smell of death stays above us, black rain falls and destroys our heads
under the dark dead sky burning in flames
there is no more god to save our lives
you're trying to run but you just can't hide
you don't believe but that's really the end

black fate for you
what can i do?
there's no future it's true
black fate for you

now there's nothing left to you
nothing else can resist
there's no water left to drink
there's no horizon to see
there's nobody left to fool
there are no lands left to overcome
there's no air left to breath
there's no longer a life to live

refrão


SILENT WHISPER
--------------
running through my words
burn in sorrow flames
left behind the door
calling for your name

when our souls fall into the night
there's no way to see a smile
you can not win this fight
and you wish you could be dead, just for a while

see the sun in the set
hope for a time out of pain
trying to pass through regret
what's the difference now, it's all in vain

searching for this love again
trying to keep up the flame
running from this love again
don't we try now to say who's to blame

where is the crowd that was here
now that i'm filled with the fear
why should i shout if no one will hear
the silent whisper from my tears


ANARQUIA MILITAR
----------------
vamos anarquizar o serviço militar!
vamos acabar com o serviço militar!
vamos desertar do serviço militar!
vamos anarquizar o serviço militar!

anarquia! anarquia militar!
anarquia! anarquia militar!
anarquia! anarquia militar!
anarquia! é preciso anarquizar!

você não pode me obrigar,
viver um ano na prisão,
ensinando a matar,
já acabou a escravidão!

não exija obediência!
eu já perdi a paciência!
não vou bater continência,
nós já temos a independência!

vamos destruir o serviço militar!
vamos demolir o serviço militar!
vamos abolir o serviço militar!
vamos instalar a anarquia militar!

refrão

vamos abolir o serviço militar!
