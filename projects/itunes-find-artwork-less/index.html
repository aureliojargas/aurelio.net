<p>You use that nice iTunes script/plugin to automatically download the album cover from the Internet, don’t you? But after using it for a while, how could you know which songs are still missing the artwork?</p>

<p>This script fills this gap, showing you the “artwork-less” songs. Then you can run the download plugin on them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Free / Open Source AppleScript (Mac only)</li>

  <dt>"With Apple TV you want all your album art to look cool. The problem: how to find out which of my 8000 songs don't have artwork. Your script, genius! Thanks!"</dt>

<h2>Road Map</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>Select the desired songs or playlist in iTunes.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>Run this script.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>Wait a moment and a new playlist named "* Missing Artwork" will appear. All the songs on it have no Album Artwork.</p>
