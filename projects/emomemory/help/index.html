<h2 id="rules">Game Rules</h2>

<p>EmoMemory is a classic memory game, also called Concentration. You have a board full of shuffled paired cards to be discovered.</p>

<ol>
  <li>All the cards are shown to you, this is the memorization time.</li>
  <li>All the cards are turned over.</li>
  <li>You reveal two cards
    <ul>
      <li>If they match, they keep revealed and you won them.</li>
      <li>If they don't match, they're turned over again.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You keep turning cards until all the pairs are matched.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="instructions">How To Play</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Press the <strong>New</strong> <img class="icon" src="/projects/emomemory/help/img/load.png" alt=""> or <strong>Retry</strong> <img class="icon" src="/projects/emomemory/help/img/retry.png" alt=""> buttons to start a game.</li>
  <li><strong>Memorization time!</strong> All the cards are shown. Keep concentrated and try to memorize the cards positions as much as you can. But don't take too long, the clock is already ticking!</li>
  <li><strong>Click any card to start.</strong> All the cards, except the one you clicked, will be turned over.</li>
  <li><strong>Find its pair.</strong> Try to remember where the card's pair was located and click there. If both cards you flipped are pairs, you've got a match! They will be left face up until the end of the game. When you flip two unrelated cards, they are just turned over again.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep clicking and matching!</strong> Keep flipping cards until all pairs are revealed. Then the game ends and your score is shown. If you make a real good time, you will appear on the Hi-Scores listing!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ab">Address Book notes</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Why Address Book is opened when the game is launched?</dt>
  <dd>It's needed to access all the pictures of your Address Book contacts.</dd>
  <dt>Why I can't choose some Address Book groups for a New game?</dt>
  <dd>These groups have very few contacts with pictures and is not suitable to compose a game. Either set pictures for more contacts on that group or choose an easier level, like Kid.</dd>
  <dt>How can I easily set pictures for my Address Book contacts?</dt>
  <dd>
    If you're an <a href="http://adiumx.com/">Adium</a> user, download <a href="/projects/adiumbook/">AdiumBook</a>, a free application to copy your friend's IM pictures to Address Book.
  </dd>
  <dt>I don't use Address Book at all. Can I disable it?</dt>
  <dd>
    Open Terminal.app and type:
    <pre>
defaults write net.aurelio.EmoMemory useAB -bool false
</pre>To enable it again later, type:
    <pre>
defaults write net.aurelio.EmoMemory useAB -bool true
</pre>Restart EmoMemory after making these changes.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>How can I reset all my Hi-Scores?</dt>
  <dd>
    Don't! But if you really want it, open Terminal.app and type:
    <pre>
defaults delete net.aurelio.EmoMemory scores
</pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
