<h2 id="science">The science behind the game</h2>

<p>This game is not just about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_memory">visual memory</a>, it's also about feelings.</p>

<p>Concentrating on people you care and love opens a new field for pleasant experiences: <a href="http://www.memory-key.com/NatureofMemory/emotion.htm">the Emotional Memory</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pleasant emotions are usually remembered better than unpleasant ones.</li>
  <li>Positive memories contain more contextual details (which in turn, helps memory).</li>
  <li>It's the emotional arousal, not the importance of the information, that helps memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_and_memory">emotion can have a powerful impact on memory.</a></p>

<p>Some studies have also discovered that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-07-22-memory_x.htm">women</a> and <a href="http://psych.ucsc.edu/matherlab/summary_emomem.html">older adults</a> have better emotional memory.</p>

<p>When playing the game on the "fast lane", trying to win stars and break records, you can also take advantage of your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconic_memory">iconic memory</a>, a powerful but short time memory.</p>
