Following the [SedSokoban URL_SOKOBAN] fever, here's the classic [Arkanoid game http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid] implemented using the good old UNIX Stream EDitor. You know, SED.

Detailed instructions are available on the script's headers.

Note: Different from the original game, this one's not funny to play or even exciting. It's cool because it's SED.
