The demo.mp4 video was recoded at June 2020 on macOS with a "retina"
screen. This means the actual recorded size will be doubled in
non-retina screens.


1. Prepare the terminal window

Set terminal window size to 73x24 (columns, lines).

Set the font size until the window is ~300 pixels wide. The goal is
having the resulting video ~600 pixels wide.

Run KeyCastr and position the keys flyovers in the bottom left of the
terminal window. Use a text size similar to the terminal font size.


2. Do the recording

Use Kap to do a screen recording (Quicktime Player is another option).

Select the desired area: only the terminal window contents, no toolbars.

Save the results as MP4.


3. Convert the video to GIF

Use ffmpeg to convert the video to GIF. Do not scale the dimensions!

Use gifsicle to optimize the GIF.

docker run \
    -v $PWD:/tmp \
    jrottenberg/ffmpeg:4.1-alpine \
        -i /tmp/file.mp4
        -r 30 \
        -f gif \
        - | gifsicle --optimize=3 --delay=3 > file.gif
